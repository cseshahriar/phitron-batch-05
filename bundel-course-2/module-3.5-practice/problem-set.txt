Question: Create three static objects with the help of the constructor of the following class.
Student
{
	name;
	roll;
	section;
	math_marks;
	cls;
}
Then compare those 3 objects and print who got the highest math_marks and print his/her name.


Question: Create a dynamic object named dhoni of the following class. Don’t use a constructor here, that means you need to fill the data by yourself.
Cricketer
{
	jersey_no;
	country;
}
Then make another dynamic object named kohli and copy the data of the dhoni object to kohli and after that delete the dhoni object. Then print the jersey_no and country of kohli object.
Note: At first try to do this, kohli=dhoni and see if it gives the correct output. If not, then think deeply why it didn’t work and try to copy the data manually like kohli->jersey_no=dhoni->jersey_no;
