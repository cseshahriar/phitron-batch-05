# graph
1. graph has multiple edge
2. graph has multiple way
3. cycle


type of graph
    1 undericted graph : no direction
    2 directed graph: has direction
    3 unweighted: weight did not define
    4 weighted: time cost, evey edge has weighted
    5 cycle: has cycle

graph can input 3 way:
    1. Adjacency Matrix
    2. Adjacency List
    3. Edge List

Adjacency Matrix:
