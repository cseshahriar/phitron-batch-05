# graph
1. graph has multiple edge
2. graph has multiple way
3. cycle

graph task:
    1. shortest path
    2. how much quiclky visit
    3. path cost

    # bfs - level order traverse

type of graph
    1 undericted graph : did not say direction / both direction(up, down)
    2 directed graph: one way direction
    3 unweighted: edge weight(cost) did not define
    4 weighted: time cost, evey edge has weighted
    5 cycle: has cycle
        undirected: min 3 node cycle
        directed : min 2 node cycle

graph can input 3 way:
    1. Adjacency Matrix: use when two node connection checking
    2. Adjacency List
    3. Edge List

Adjacency Matrix:
